    <h1>Dashclicker</h1>
    <p>
      Dashclicker is an open-source free-to-play incremental clicker game. This
      is the second iteration of the game, rewritten from scratch in Angular.
      Initial version of the game is still available for play at
      <a href="http://old.dashclicker.com" target="_blank"
        >old.dashclicker.com</a
      >.

    <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
    <div>
      <h6>I am stuck, next upgrades are unreachable</h6>

      <p>
        If you can't reach a task milestone, try stocking up on clicks &
        analytics and using the Restart game button you'll find in your wallet.
        Due to the way of how costs and prices are calculated, this is the
        actual way of how to progress in the game (<em>prestige mechanic</em>).
        While tasks reset costs, calculations for the next upgrade costs take
        into account your already owned number of upgrades, thus you should
        upgrade as far as possible before using resets from tasks.
      </p>

      <h6>How long does it take to complete the game?</h6>
      <p>
        It should take you around 2-4 hours to complete the game (all tasks
        finished, level #50 reached), but as new features are added, the play
        time might increase considerably.
      </p>

      <h6>There is too much clicking, there is no <em>Buy max</em> button</h6>
      <p>
        If you are playing on a computer, you can click on a button and hold
        Enter key to trigger the action repeatedly. You can also navigate
        between buttons by pressing Tab (forwards) or Shift-Tab (backwards).
      </p>
      <h6>How does the wallet work?</h6>
      <p>
        Values listed in <strong>bold</strong> are the actual values stored in
        the wallet, while the values after slash / are maximal values the wallet
        has ever held. If you want to keep your assets between different
        sessions / devices, deposit into your wallet before exiting the game.
      </p>

      <h6>I started the game as a guest but now want to create an account</h6>
      <p>
        You can transfer assets between accounts. While logged into your guest
        account: 1) withdraw from wallet (note that it is not possible to
        withdraw boosts) 2) log out 3) register an account 4) deposit into
        wallet.
      </p>

      <h6>I logged in and found my wallet empty</h6>

      <p>
        Most likely you didn't deposit your assets before exiting the game,
        which can be considered a <em>hard reset</em> of the game. If you want
        to restore your assets, write an e-mail to
        <a href="mailto:dashclicker@dashclicker.com" target="_blank"
          >dashclicker@dashclicker.com</a
        >
        and I will reset your wallet to the max values it had in it.
      </p>
